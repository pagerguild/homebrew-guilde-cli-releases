Make unit tests where it's simple to do so.

Each call out to the github client should be done in a separate strategy method, so that we can "test by visual inspection"
and then mock that method in tests.

Similar with stuff like checksums that require filesystem setup, let's just mock those.

use [mock_test.go](mdc:mkrelease/mock_test.go) for the mock.

Maintain a "Happy Path" test that uses a mock object to validate the sequence.

Whenever a new strategy step is added, make sure it's reflected in the "Happy Path" test.

Run `just lint_and_test` after changes, and fix whatever error messages you get back.
